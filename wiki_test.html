        <p class="padding-bottom">The wiki is one of the most important deliverables for any team, providing a platform for everything a team
            has achieved. Over the last half-year, we put a lot of time and hard work into this wiki and along the way
            we went from complete novices to passionate web designers. We have learned a lot about web design and user
            experience and this page attempts to capture some of that knowledge and make it available for the following
            generations of iGEM teams.

            <p>In this day and age, more web traffic goes by phone than all the other platforms combined. Therefore, it is
            important to design your wiki for both mobile and desktop. Now it is true that extensive reading sessions
            are not commonly performed on a phone, but we believe a strong mobile experience is important for users who
            want to explore questions that pop up into their heads easily.
            </p>
            <p class="padding-bottom">A good mobile experience is not an after-thought when designing a page, it is important to think about both
            the desktop and mobile layout at once. For this wiki, we have made extensive use of a grid system, commonly
            found in most css frameworks. This allows for easy rescaling and repositioning when switching devices. All
            modern browsers have a developer option that can display your page in a mobile format, allowing you to
            easily develop for all screen sizes.

            <h3 class="grape-purple-text">Design philosophy</h3>
            <div class="divider-small grape-purple"></div>
            <p class="padding-bottom">A website allows us to do far more than a regular word processor, they allow us to make more complex layouts
            that can help to streamline the user experience. Visual hierarchy is important in communicating the
            structure of your wiki to the user. But this is a hard thing to get right, especially when still learning
            (web)design. We therefore found it helpful to adopt a strong design philosophy. For this wiki, we have
            decided early on to follow the material design philosophy. Material design tries to get rid of most of the
            fuzz by limiting the use of bright colors, depth, and animations and uses them only to communicate function.
            Itâ€™s minimalistic approach and low visual complexity allow novices to quickly pick up the style and we can
            recommend it for these very reasons.

            <p class="padding-bottom">This wiki was designed as a platform that can be adapted by later teams for their own use. To this end, we
            have written a <a href="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/c/c6/T--Wageningen_UR--Wiki_guide.pdf">guide</a>
            that teaches you the basics of working with our wiki. It is written for people who have no knowledge of HTML
                              and want to learn the basics. We have also written <a
                                  href="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/8/89/T--Wageningen_UR--Wiki_writing_style_guide.pdf">general
                                  guidelines</a> for writing content for this wiki, as to ensure a consistent style throughout the wiki.
                              We recommend other teams to draw inspiration from this document and formulate their project-specific
                              guidelines. Below you will find more on the technical details of this wiki.

        <section id="Notes" class="scrollspy">
            <h3 class="grape-purple-text">Notes to the more seasoned reader</h3>
            <div class="divider-small grape-purple"></div>
            <p class="padding-bottom">Each page has two fixed elements: the top, containing all the style sheets and the navigation menu and the
            bottom, which contains the footer, navigation menu and the scripts. This wiki is built on top of the
            materialize css framework. This framework comes with basic web components designed according to material
            design principles. Our main style sheet is compiled from sass, which allows for easier writing of css code.
            The main css file is minified making it hard to read for a human, but the annotated sass source code is
            available <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Template:Wageningen_UR/scss/main.scss">here</a>. This sass file
            contains variables that allow you to easily modify the main colors of the webpage, making it easy to
            implement your own style. All the pages on this wiki provide a useful resource for coding examples.
